## Introduction

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem with the "naive" assumption of conditional independence between features. It's widely used for text classification, spam detection, sentiment analysis, and other classification tasks where features can be treated as independent.

The algorithm is called "naive" because it assumes that all features are independent of each other, which is often not true in real-world scenarios but still produces remarkably good results in practice.

## Core Probability Concepts

Naive Bayes classification relies on three fundamental probability concepts:

### Posterior Probability P(Class|Word)
**Definition:** What's the updated probability that this word belongs to this class

**Examples:**
- P("spam"|"free") - Probability that an email is spam given it contains "free"
- P("ham"|"free") - Probability that an email is legitimate given it contains "free"

### Likelihood P(Word|Class)
**Definition:** Given we're in Class X, what's the probability we'll see this particular word? or what's the probability we'll see this particular word in the given class X

**Examples:**
- P("free"|spam) might be 0.05, meaning 5% of all words in spam emails are "free"
- P("free"|ham) might be 0.001, meaning only 0.1% of words in legitimate emails are "free"

### Prior Probability P(Class)
**Definition:** The initial probability of the class before seeing any words

**Examples:**
- P("spam") - Overall probability that any email is spam
- P("ham") - Overall probability that any email is legitimate

---

## Bayes' Theorem Foundation

Naive Bayes classification is built on Bayes' theorem:

```
P(Class|Word) = P(Word|Class) × P(Class) / P(Word)
```

For classification, we compare:
```
P("spam"|"free") = P("free"|"spam") × P("spam")
P("ham"|"free") = P("free"|"ham") × P("ham")
```

**Decision Rule:**
Finally we will compare which class has high Posterior probability then we will assign that word to that class.

---

## Classification Process

The core classification formulas are:

```
P("spam"|"free") = P("free"|"spam") × P("spam")
P("ham"|"free") = P("free"|"ham") × P("ham")
```

**Decision Rule:**
Finally we will compare which class has high Posterior probability then we will assign that word to that class.

**Process:**
1. Calculate posterior probability for each class
2. Compare the results
3. Assign the word/document to the class with the highest posterior probability

---

## Worked Example: Spam Detection

**Given Data:**
- P("free"|spam) = 0.05, P("free"|ham) = 0.001
- P("spam") = 0.4, P("ham") = 0.6

**Calculations:**
```
P("spam"|"free") = 0.05 × 0.4 = 0.02
P("ham"|"free") = 0.001 × 0.6 = 0.0006
```

**Decision:** Since 0.02 > 0.0006, classify as **SPAM**.

## Multinomial Naive Bayes Example

### Training Dataset

| Doc No | Document | Class |
|--------|----------|-------|
| 0 | coffee tea soup coffee coffee | Hot |
| 1 | coffee is hot and so is soup and tea | Hot |
| 2 | espresso is a hot coffee and not a tea | Hot |
| 3 | coffee is neither tea nor soup | Hot |
| 4 | sprite pepsi cold coffee and cold tea | Cold |

### Class Distribution
- **Total documents:** 5
- **Hot class:** 4 documents
- **Cold class:** 1 document

---

## Bag of Words Implementation

### Vocabulary Creation
```
Words = ["coffee", "cold", "espresso", "hot", "pepsi", "soup", "sprite", "tea"]
```

### Document Vectorization

| Doc | coffee | cold | espresso | hot | pepsi | soup | sprite | tea |
|-----|--------|------|----------|-----|-------|------|--------|-----|
| 0   | 3      | 0    | 0        | 0   | 0     | 1    | 0      | 1   |
| 1   | 1      | 0    | 0        | 1   | 0     | 1    | 0      | 1   |
| 2   | 1      | 0    | 1        | 1   | 0     | 0    | 0      | 1   |
| 3   | 1      | 0    | 0        | 0   | 0     | 1    | 0      | 1   |
| 4   | 1      | 2    | 0        | 0   | 1     | 0    | 1      | 1   |

### Word Count Summary

**Hot Class (Documents 0-3):**
```
Total = [6, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4]
```

**Cold Class (Document 4):**
```
Total = [1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
```

## Probability Calculations

### Prior Probabilities
```
P(Hot) = 4/5 = 0.8
P(Cold) = 1/5 = 0.2
```

### Word Count Totals
- **Total words in Hot class:** 16
- **Total words in Cold class:** 6

### Likelihood Calculations (Without Smoothing)

| Word | n_Hot | P(w\|Hot) | n_Cold | P(w\|Cold) |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|------------|
| coffee | 6 | 6/16 | 1 | 1/6 |
| cold | 0 | 0/16 | 2 | 2/6 |
| espresso | 1 | 1/16 | 0 | 0/6 |
| hot | 2 | 2/16 | 0 | 0/6 |
| pepsi | 0 | 0/16 | 1 | 1/6 |
| soup | 3 | 3/16 | 0 | 0/6 |
| sprite | 0 | 0/16 | 1 | 1/6 |
| tea | 4 | 4/16 | 1 | 1/6 |

## Test Document Classification

### Test Document
```
"I hate cold coffee but love tea and hot coffee"
```

### Bag of Words for Test Document
```
words = ["cold", "coffee", "tea", "hot", "hate", "love"]
```

### Classification Calculations

**For Hot Class:**
```
P(Hot|w) = P(w|Hot) × P(Hot)
= P(cold|Hot) × P(coffee|Hot) × P(tea|Hot) × P(hot|Hot) × P(hate|Hot) × P(love|Hot) × P(Hot)
= (0/16) × (6/16) × (4/16) × (2/16) × (0/16) × (0/16) × (4/5)
= 0
```

**For Cold Class:**
```
P(Cold|w) = P(w|Cold) × P(Cold)
= P(cold|Cold) × P(coffee|Cold) × P(tea|Cold) × P(hot|Cold) × P(hate|Cold) × P(love|Cold) × P(Cold)
= (2/6) × (1/6) × (1/6) × (0/6) × (0/6) × (0/6) × (1/5)
= 0
```

**Problem:** Both probabilities become zero due to unseen words!

---

## Laplace Smoothing

### The Zero Probability Problem
When a word doesn't appear in training data for a class, the entire probability becomes zero. To avoid this, we use **Laplace Smoothing**.

**Laplace Smoothing Formula:**
```
P(word|class) = (count + 1) / (total words + vocabulary size)
```

### After Laplace Smoothing

| Word | Hot Count | P(w\|Hot) | Cold Count | P(w\|Cold) |
|------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| coffee | 6+1 | 7/24 | 1+1 | 2/14 |
| cold | 0+1 | 1/24 | 2+1 | 3/14 |
| espresso | 1+1 | 2/24 | 0+1 | 1/14 |
| hot | 2+1 | 3/24 | 0+1 | 1/14 |
| pepsi | 0+1 | 1/24 | 1+1 | 2/14 |
| soup | 3+1 | 4/24 | 0+1 | 1/14 |
| sprite | 0+1 | 1/24 | 1+1 | 2/14 |
| tea | 4+1 | 5/24 | 1+1 | 2/14 |

**Where:**
- Hot total = 16 + 8 = 24 (original count + vocabulary size)
- Cold total = 6 + 8 = 14 (original count + vocabulary size)

### Final Classification with Smoothing

**For Hot Class:**
```
P(Hot|w) = (1/24) × (7/24) × (5/24) × (3/24) × (1/24) × (1/24) × (4/5)
= 0.00000549
```

**For Cold Class:**
```
P(Cold|w) = (3/14) × (2/14) × (2/14) × (1/14) × (1/14) × (1/14) × (1/5)
= 0.0000319
```

**Decision:** Since 0.0000319 > 0.00000549, classify as **COLD**.

**Interpretation:**
The probability of Cold is greater than Hot, so the given document is classified as Cold.

## Binomial vs Multinomial

### Multinomial Approach
- Considers **word frequency** (how many times a word appears)
- Uses actual word counts in calculations
- Better for documents where word repetition matters

### Binomial Approach
- Considers only **word presence** (whether a word appears or not)
- Uses binary values (0 or 1) for word occurrence
- Simpler but loses frequency information

### When to Use Each
- **Multinomial:** When word frequency is important (e.g., sentiment analysis)
- **Binomial:** When only word presence matters (e.g., topic classification)

**Note:** "In case of Binomial, rather than considering the total count, we will consider only whether the word is present or not."

### Binomial Example

For the same test document, using binary presence:

| Doc | coffee | cold | espresso | hot | pepsi | soup | sprite | tea |
|-----|--------|------|----------|-----|-------|------|--------|-----|
| 0   | 1      | 0    | 0        | 0   | 0     | 1    | 0      | 1   |
| 1   | 1      | 0    | 0        | 1   | 0     | 1    | 0      | 1   |
| 2   | 1      | 0    | 1        | 1   | 0     | 0    | 0      | 1   |
| 3   | 1      | 0    | 0        | 0   | 0     | 1    | 0      | 1   |
| 4   | 1      | 1    | 0        | 0   | 1     | 0    | 1      | 1   |

**Hot Class Totals:** [4, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4]
**Cold Class Totals:** [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

## Word Frequency Impact on Classification

### Understanding Word Frequency in Classification

In multinomial Naive Bayes, the **frequency of words within a document** significantly impacts the final classification decision. When a word appears multiple times in a document, it gets "counted" multiple times in the probability calculation, giving it more influence on the final classification.

### Mathematical Foundation

For a document with multiple word occurrences, the probability calculation becomes:

```
P(class|document) = P(class) × ∏ P(word|class)^count(word)
```

Where `count(word)` is the number of times the word appears in the document.

### Example 1: Cold Classification

**Document:** "cold coffee will be more cold when you drink in the cold place"

**Word Analysis:**
- **"cold" appears 3 times**
- "coffee" appears 1 time
- Other words: "will", "be", "more", "when", "you", "drink", "in", "the", "place"

**Key Insight:** The word "cold" appears 3 times, so it gets multiplied 3 times in the probability calculation:
```
P(Cold|document) ∝ P(Cold) × P(cold|Cold)³ × P(coffee|Cold) × P(other words|Cold)
```

**Expected Classification:** **COLD** - because the repeated occurrence of "cold" dominates the probability calculation.

### Example 2: Hot Classification

**Document:** "cold coffee will be hot when you drink in the hot place"

**Word Analysis:**
- **"hot" appears 2 times**
- "cold" appears 1 time
- "coffee" appears 1 time
- Other words: "will", "be", "when", "you", "drink", "in", "the", "place"

**Key Insight:** Despite having the word "cold", the word "hot" appears twice:
```
P(Hot|document) ∝ P(Hot) × P(hot|Hot)² × P(cold|Hot) × P(coffee|Hot) × P(other words|Hot)
P(Cold|document) ∝ P(Cold) × P(hot|Cold)² × P(cold|Cold) × P(coffee|Cold) × P(other words|Cold)
```

**Expected Classification:** **HOT** - because the repeated occurrence of "hot" (2 times) gives it more weight than the single occurrence of "cold".

### Step-by-Step Calculation Example

Using our training data probabilities with Laplace smoothing:

**For Document: "cold coffee will be hot when you drink in the hot place"**

**Word Frequencies:**
- hot: 2 times
- cold: 1 time  
- coffee: 1 time
- Other words (unseen): 6 times

**Hot Class Calculation:**
```
P(Hot|document) = P(Hot) × P(hot|Hot)² × P(cold|Hot) × P(coffee|Hot) × P(unseen|Hot)⁶
= (4/5) × (3/24)² × (1/24) × (7/24) × (1/24)⁶
= 0.8 × (0.125)² × 0.042 × 0.292 × (0.042)⁶
= 0.8 × 0.0156 × 0.042 × 0.292 × very small number
```

**Cold Class Calculation:**
```
P(Cold|document) = P(Cold) × P(hot|Cold)² × P(cold|Cold) × P(coffee|Cold) × P(unseen|Cold)⁶
= (1/5) × (1/14)² × (3/14) × (2/14) × (1/14)⁶
= 0.2 × (0.071)² × 0.214 × 0.143 × (0.071)⁶
= 0.2 × 0.005 × 0.214 × 0.143 × very small number
```

**Result:** The Hot class would likely have a higher probability due to:
1. Higher prior probability P(Hot) = 0.8 vs P(Cold) = 0.2
2. Better likelihood for "hot" appearing twice: P(hot|Hot)² > P(hot|Cold)²

### Key Insights

1. **Word Repetition Matters:** Words that appear multiple times in a document have exponentially more influence on classification.

2. **Frequency vs Presence:** In multinomial Naive Bayes, saying "very very very good" is different from saying "very good" - the repeated "very" increases the probability calculation.

3. **Dominant Words:** A few highly repeated class-indicative words can override the influence of many other words.

4. **Training Data Influence:** The classification depends on how frequently these words appeared in each class during training.

### Practical Implications

- **Document Length:** Longer documents with repeated key words get stronger classification confidence
- **Keyword Density:** Documents with high density of class-specific words are classified more confidently
- **Balanced Training:** Training data should represent realistic word frequency patterns

**Important Note:** Based on the previous probability values, the class is assigned. As the word "hot" is appearing more times in the document "cold coffee will be hot when you drink in the hot place", there is a high chance that this document will be classified as class Hot, because the probability will be calculated for all words present in the document.
